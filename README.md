# Medicus
This was our final project for our Software Engineering class. We built a GUI to represent a healthcare app. The app's functions include: virtual medical portal, meal prep, home delivery of food, medicine, etc.  To assist the service providers as well as the customers to keep record of their services and routine assistance. We implemented users to have certain priviledges based on their user type. There are four types of users: Client, Admin, Provider, Physician.  Clients are able to create new orders(food or medicine), view their medical and order history Admins are able to view all operations Providers get a notification when there is a new order. They can view their past orders (that they completed) in a list format. They can also view the new orders in a list format as well. They also have the ability to contact the customer's physician to make sure the order (medicine) is appropriate. Physicians have a list of all their clients that they are taking care of and is able to view their medical histories.
